# Spicy Corner Website

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this website. Mainly the most popular CSS framework, Boostrap framework and font-awsome icon library were used to improve the appearance of the website. jQuery was used for the animation used on the website. This website is a one page website. This website is divided into sections. Menus are used in the navbar to access each section. Many of the properties of the boostrap framework were used to create this website. Google fonts were used for the fonts of the website. White, black, gray and red were used as the main colors of this website. Red color was used especially for hyperlinks. Boostrap properties were used to make the website responsive.
